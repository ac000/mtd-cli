Coding Style
============

We follow the Linux kernel `coding
style <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst>`__.

As a general rule :-

-  all indentation is tabs (set to 8 char) with the exception of
   continuation lines that are aligned with tabs and then spaces

-  all keywords followed by a ‘(’ have a space in between

.. code:: c

       if (condition)

       for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)

-  function calls do NOT have a space between their name and argument

.. code:: c

       i = some_function(argument);

-  usually there is no space on the inside of parenthesis (see examples
   above)

-  function / method implementations have their opening curly braces in
   column 1

-  all other opening curly braces follow at the end of the line, with a
   space separating them:

.. code:: c

       if (condition) {
           dosomething();
           dosomethingelse();
       }

-  both sides of an if / else clause either use or do not use curly
   braces:

.. code:: c

       if (condition)
           i = 4;
       else
           j = 6;

       if (condition) {
           i = 6;
       } else {
           i = 4;
           j = 6;
       }

-  don’t do assignments inside if () statements, always do it this way

.. code:: c

       res = something();
       if (!res)
           return NULL;

-  if you don’t need the result you can do

.. code:: c

       if (!something())
           return NULL;

-  use space to make visual separation easier

.. code:: c

       a = b + 3 + e / 4;

-  continuation lines have the operator / comma at the end

.. code:: c

          if (very_long_conditiont_1 ||
              condition_2)

           b = a + (c + d +
                    f + z);

-  switch statements with blocks are a little bit special (to avoid
   indenting too far)

.. code:: c

       switch (foo) {
       case FIRST:
           whatever();
           break;
       case SECOND: {
           int i;
           for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
               do_something(i);
       }
       }

-  comments should be C style not C++/C99

   for single line comments

.. code:: c

       /* This is a single line comment */

for multi-line comments

.. code:: c

       /*
        * This is a multi
        * line comment
        */

-  variable declarations should be at the beginning of a code block, not
   interspersed in the middle

-  variable and function naming should be all lower case with \_ used
   for spaces
